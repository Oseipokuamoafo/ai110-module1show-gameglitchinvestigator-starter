# 🎮 Game Glitch Investigator: The Impossible Guesser

## 🚨 The Situation

You asked an AI to build a simple "Number Guessing Game" using Streamlit.
It wrote the code, ran away, and now the game is unplayable. 

- You can't win.
- The hints lie to you.
- The secret number seems to have commitment issues.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the broken app: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

## 🕵️‍♂️ Your Mission

1. **Play the game.** Open the "Developer Debug Info" tab in the app to see the secret number. Try to win.
2. **Find the State Bug.** Why does the secret number change every time you click "Submit"? Ask ChatGPT: *"How do I keep a variable from resetting in Streamlit when I click a button?"*
3. **Fix the Logic.** The hints ("Higher/Lower") are wrong. Fix them.
4. **Refactor & Test.** - Move the logic into `logic_utils.py`.
   - Run `pytest` in your terminal.
   - Keep fixing until all tests pass!

## 📝 Document Your Experience

- [ ] Describe the game's purpose.
The app is a Streamlit-based Number Guessing Game. The player tries to guess a secret integer (typically 1–100). After each guess the app gives a hint — "Higher" or "Lower" — until the player finds the secret number.
- [ ] Detail which bugs you found.
The secret number reset on every interaction because it was reinitialized on each Streamlit rerun instead of being persisted in st.session_state.
The hint logic was incorrect (comparisons were reversed), causing the app to tell the player the wrong direction.
Attempt/count state wasn't preserved across reruns, making progress tracking unreliable.

- [ ] Explain what fixes you applied.
Persisted the secret number and attempt counter using st.session_state so values survive button clicks and reruns.
Corrected the comparison logic so the app displays "Higher" when the guess is less than the secret and "Lower" when the guess is greater than the secret.
Refactored core game logic into logic_utils.py (pure functions for checking guesses and generating hints) and added unit tests in tests/ to verify behavior. After these changes the tests pass with pytest.
